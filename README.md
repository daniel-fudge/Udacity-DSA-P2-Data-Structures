# Udacity Data Structures & Algorithms Nanodegree - Project 2
This is the second project of the Udacity Data Structures & Algorithms Nanodegree. This project comes at the end of the 
Data Structures section, which covers:
1. Arrays and Linked Lists
2. Stacks and Queues
3. Recursion
4. Trees
5. Maps and Hashing

## Project Overview
This project is divided into six separate problems. Solutions for each of these are captured by the `problem-[p].py` 
files in this repo. 

### Problem 1 - Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache
The first problem develops an LRU cache with a constant O(1) time complexity for each set/put and get operation.

### Problem 2 - File Recursion

### Problem 3 - Huffman Coding

### Problem 4 - Active Directory

### Problem 5 - Blockchain

### Problem 6 - Union and Intersection
